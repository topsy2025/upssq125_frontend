        <h2>Server-side Vs Client-side Code</h2>
        <p>When you hear the term server-side and client-side code,especially in the content of web development.Client-side code is code that runs on the user computer <span>-</span>When the web page is view,the pages client-side is downloaded then run and display by the browser.In this module we are currently talking about client-side javascript</p>
        <p>Server-side code on the other hand is run on the server then its result are downloaded on the browser and display.Examples of popular server-side web languages include:php,python,ruby and javascript.Javascript can also be use as aserver-side language e.gin the popular node.js</p>

        <h3>Dynamic VS Static Code</h3>
        <p>The word <strong>Dynamic</strong>is used to describe both client-side javascript and server-side language-it refers to the ability to update the display the web page app to show different things in the different circumstances generating new content as required.Server-side code dynamically generate new content on the server for e.g pulling data from a database,whereas client-side javascript dynamically generate new content inside the browser on the client.e.gcreating a new html table,filling it with data requested from the server,then displaying the tables in the webpage shown to the users.The meaning is slightly different in two contents but related and both approaches(server-side and client-side usually works together)</p>
        <br>
        <p>A web page with no dynamically updating content is refered to as <strong><span>-</span>it just shows the same content all the time</strong></p>
