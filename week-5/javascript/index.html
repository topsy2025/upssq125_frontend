    <h2>What is javascript</h2>
</header>
  <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>What is javascript and how does it fits</li>
  <li>Adding javascript to a website</li>
  <li>What can you do with javascript</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>A high level definition</h3>
  <p>Javascript is a scripting or programming languages that allows you to implement complex features on webpages.Everytime a webpage does more than just sit there to display statis information pop-up .Javascript is a third layer of the three standard,the other two include html and css.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Html</h4>
        <p>Html is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content for example,defining paragraphs,heading and data tables for embedding</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Css</h4>
        <p>Css is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our html content for example,setting background colors and fonts.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <h4>Javascript</h4>
        <p>Javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content control multi-media,animate images and pretty much everything else</p>
     </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The three layer build on top of one another</p>
  <button type="button">Player 1:Awesome</button>

  <h3>Things Javascript Can Do</h3>
  <p>The core clients call javascript language consists of common programming features that allows you to do things like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can store useful values inside variables,in the above example for instance,it ask for a new name to be enter then store that name in the variables called name.</li>
    <li>Operations on pieces of text (known as strings in programming)in the above example,we take the string player 1 and join it to the name variable to create the complete text"player 1:Awesome"</li>
    <li>Running codes in response to certain event occur on a webpage.we use a click event in our example above to detect when a label is click and then run the code that update the label </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Certain functionality are built on top of the client side called javascript language and this functionality are called application programming interface(api)this API gives extra super power to your javascript code</p>

  <h3>What is javascript doing on your webpage</h3>
  <p>What happens when javascript is run on your page?When you load a webpage in your browser,you are running your code(html,css and javascript)inside an execution environment (the browser tab).This is like a factory that takes in raw materials(the code)and output a product(the webpage)</p>
  <p>A very common use of javascript is to dynamically modify html and css to update user interface by mean of document object model that we discuss above</p>
  <h3>Browser Security</h3>
  <p>Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code (this bucket are called execution environment in technical terms).This means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely separately and the code in one tab can not directly affect the code in another tab.</p>
  <h3>Javascript Running Order</h3>
  <p>When a browser encounter a block of javascript,it generally runs it in order from top to bottom.This means that you need to be careful that what order you put in</p>
  <p>In the first example,the code block is called"update name"parenthesis(this type of reusable code are called functions)this code block ask a user for a new name and insert the new name into the text of the button.when we store a reference to a button using document,query selectors and attaches an event listener to it using"add event listener"so that when the button is click,the update name functions is wrong </p>
  <p>If we were swap the other of the const buttons=...and button.Add event listener(..)the code will not work.Instead you will get an error return in browser developer concept and the error will say uncot refrerence error:can not access button before initialisation.This means that the button has not been iniatialised yet so we can not add an event listener to it</p>
  <br>
  <div class="note"><strong>Note:it is not always true that javascript in order from top to bottom due to behaviours like hosting but from bear in mind that items need to be define before you see them</strong></div>
  <h3>INTERPRETED Vs COMPILED CODE</h3>
  <p>You might hear the terms interpreted and compile in the content of programming.In interpreted language the code is run from top to bottom and the result of runni ng the code is immediately return.You dont have to transform the code into a different forms before the browser runs it.The code is received in its programmer friendly text font and processed directly from that</p>
  <br>
  <p>Compiled languages on the other hand are transform(compiled)into another form before they are run by the computer e.g c/c++ are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer.The program is executed from a binary format,which was generated from the original program source code</p>
  <br>
  <p>Javascript is a light weight interpreted programming language.The web browser receive the javascript code in its original text form and runs the script from that.From a technical stand point,most modeling javascript interpreters actually used a technic called just-in-time compiling(JIT) to improve performance ;The javascript source code get compiled into a faster binary format while the script is been used so that it can be run as quickly aspossible. However javascriptis still considered an interpreted language since the compilation is handled at run time rather than ahead of time</p>

  <script>
    function updateName() {
  const name = prompt("Enter a new name");
  button.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", updateName);

 </script>
